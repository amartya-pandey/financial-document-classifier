and reintroducing them into the wild .  
 
Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policie s 
 
Basis of presentation  –The financial statements of Big National Charity, Inc.  have been prepared in 
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""US GAAP""), which require Big National 
Charity, Inc.  to report  information regarding its financial position and activities according to the following 
net asset  classifications:   
 
Net assets without donor r estrictions : Net assets that are not subject to donor -imposed 
restrictions and may be expended for any purpose in  performing the primary objectives of the 
organization. The se net assets may be used at the  discre tion of Big National Charity, Inc. 's 
management and the board of directors . 
 
Net assets with donor restrictions : Net assets subject to stipulations imposed by donor s, and 
grantor s. Some donor restrictions are temporary in nature;  those restrictions will be  met by 
actions of Big National Charity , Inc.  or by the passage of time. Other donor restrictions are 
perpetual in nature, where by the donor has stipulated the funds be maintained in perpetuity.  
 
Donor restricted contributions are reported as increases i n net assets with donor restrictions. 
When a restriction expires, net assets are reclassified from net assets with donor restrictions to 
net assets without donor restrictions in the statement s of activities.  
 
Measure of operations  The statement s of activities reports all changes in net assets, including changes 
in net assets  from operati ng and non operating activities. Operating activities consist of those items 
attributable  to Big National Charity, Inc. 's ongoing animal services  and interest and  divid ends earned on 
investments. Non operating activities are limited to resources that generate  return from investments and 
other activities considered to be of a more unusual or nonrecurring nature.   
 
Cash and cash equivalents  Big National Charity, Inc. 's cash consists of cash on deposit with banks. Cash 
equivalents represent money  market funds or short -term investments with original maturities of three 
months or less from the date of  purchase, except for those amounts that are held in the investment

 Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)  
 
Concentrations of credit risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject Big National Charity, Inc.  
to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and investments. Big 
National Charity, Inc.  maintains its  cash and cash equivalents in various bank accounts that, at times, may 
exceed federally insured limits.  Big National Charity, Inc. 's cash and cash e quivalent accounts have been 
placed with high credit quality  financial institutions. Big National Charity, Inc.  has not experienced, nor 
does it anticipate, any losses with  respect to such accounts.   
 
Contributions receivable  Unconditional promises to give that are expected to be collected within one 
year are recorded at net  realizable value. Unconditional promises to give that are expected to be collected 
in future years are  recorded at the present value of their estimated future cash flows . The discounts on 
those amounts are  computed using risk -adjusted interest rates applicable to the years in which the 
promises are received.  Discount amortization is  included in contribution revenue. Conditional promises 
to give are not  included as support  until the conditions are met.   
 
As of December 31, 20 XX, Big National Charity, Inc. 's contributions receivable consisted of unconditional  
promises to give in the amount of $150,000  and receivables from third party processors in the amount of 
$94,000, all of which are expected to be collected  within one year. As of December 31, 20 XX, contributions 
receivable consisted of unconditional promises to  give in the amount of $301,000  and receivables from 
third party pr ocessors in the amount of $108,000 .  
 
Due to/from related parties  Amounts reported as due to/from related parties, included in the 
accompanying statement s of financial position,  arise principally from the collaborative activities between 
Big National Charity, Inc. , Big National Charity, Inc.  Interna tional, and Big National Charity, Inc.  Canada to 
further the mission of the organization.   
 
Property and equipment, net  Property and equipment are stated at cost at the date of purchase or, for 
donated assets, at  fair value at the date of donation, less accumulated  depreciation. Depreciation is 
calculated using the straight -line method over the lesser of the estimated  useful lives of the assets or the 
lease term. The useful lives range from three to seven years. Big Na tional Charity, Inc. 's policy is to 
capitalize renewals and betterments acquired for greater than $5,000 and expense  normal repairs and 
maintenance as incurred. Big National Charity, Inc. 's management periodically  evaluates whether events 
or circumstances have occurred indicating that the carrying amount of long -lived  assets may not be 
recovered.   
 
Investments  Investments are reported at cost , if purchased, or at fair value, if donated . Thereafter, 
investments are reported at their fair values in the statements of financial position, and c hanges in fair 
value are reported as investment  return in the statement s of activities.   
 
Purchases and sales of securities are reflected on a trade -date basis. Gains and losses on sales of securities  
are based on ave rage cost and are recorded in the statement s of activities in the period in which the 
securities  are sold. Interest is recorded when earned. Dividends are accrued as of the ex -dividend date.

 Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued ) 
 
Fair value measurements  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset  in 
the principal or most advantageous market for the asset in an orderly transaction  between market 
participants on the measurement date. Fair value sho uld be based on the assumptions  market participants 
would use when pricing an asset . US GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes  investments 
based on those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to  quoted prices in  active 
markets (observable inputs) and the lowest priority to an entity's assumptions  (unobservable inputs). Big 
National Charity, Inc.  groups assets at fair value in three levels,  based on the markets in which the assets 
and liabilities are traded and th e reliability of the assumptions used  to determine fair value. These levels 
are:  
 
Level 1  Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of 
the measurement date.   
 
Level 2  Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including:   
• Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets;   
• Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non -active markets;   
• Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset/liability; and,  
• Inputs that are derived principally from or c orroborated by other observable market 
data.   
 
Level 3  Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data.   
 
Contributions Contributions received are recorded as net assets without donor restri ctions or net 
assets with donor restrictions , depending on the existence and/or nature of any donor -imposed  
restrictions. Contributions that are restricted by the donor are reported as an increase in net assets  
without donor  restrictions if the restriction  expires in the reporting period in which the contribution is 
recognized. All other donor  restricted contributions are reported as an increase in net assets  with donor 
restrictions , depending on the nature of restriction. When a restriction expires (that i s, when a stipulated 
time restriction ends or purpose restriction is accomplished ), net assets  with donor restrictions  are 
reclassified to net assets  without donor restrictions  and reported in the statement s of activities as net 
assets released from restri ctions.   
 
Contributed property and equipment are recorded at fair value at the date of donation. Contributions  with 
donor -imposed stipulations regarding how long the contributed assets must be used are recorded as  net 
assets with donor restrictions ; otherw ise, the contributions are recorded as net assets without donor 
restrictions .

In-kind donations  Big National Charity, Inc.  received donated professional services  and other 
advertising services of  $13,000 for the year ended December 31, 20 XX. Such amounts, which are based 
upon  information provided by third -party service providers, are recorded at their estimated fair value 
determined  on the date of contribution and are reported as cont ributions in -kind and supporting services  
on the accompanying statements of activities and statements of functional expenses.   
 
Several volunteers have made significant contributions of their time in furtherance of Big National Charity, 
Inc.'s mission. These services were not reflected in the accompanying statement s of activities because  
they do not meet the necessary criteria for recognition under US GAAP .  
 
Functional expenses  The costs of providing program and other  activities have been summarized on a 
functional  basis in the statement s of activities. Accordingly, certain costs have been allocated among 
animal services  and supporting services benefited. Such allocations are determined by management on 
an equitable ba sis.  
 
The expenses that are allocated include the following:  
 
Expense Method of Allocation
Grants Time and effort
Salaries and benefits Time and effort
Education and awareness Time and effort
Occupancy Square Footage
Professional services Full Time Equivalent
Printing Full Time Equivalent
Information technologies Full Time Equivalent
Travel Time and effort
Depreciation Square Footage
Other Time and effort
 
 
Use of estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with  US GAAP  requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported  amounts and  disclosures. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Income taxes  –Big National Charity, Inc.  is exempt from income tax under IRC section 501(c)(3), though 
it is subject to tax  on income unrelated to its exempt purpose, unless that income is otherwise excluded 
by the Code. Big National Charity, Inc.  has processes presently in place to ensure the maintenance of its 
tax-exempt status; to  identify and report unrelated income; to det ermine its filing and tax obligations in 
jurisdictions for which it  has nexus; and to identify and evaluate other matters that may be considered tax 
positions. Big National Charity, Inc.  has determined that there are no material uncertain tax positions tha t 
require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.   
 
Reclassifications  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current  year 
presentation.   
 
New Accounting Pronouncement  On August 18, 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016 -14, Not -for-Profit 
Entities (Topic 958) Presentation of Financial Statements of Not -for-Profit Entities . The update addresses 
the complexity and understandability of net asset classification, deficiencies in information about liquidity 
and availability o f resources, and the lack of consistency in the type of information provided about 
expenses and investment return.  Big National Charity, Inc. has adjusted the presentation of these 
statements accordingly.  The ASU has been applied retrospectively to all p eriods presented.  
 
Note 3 Availability and Liquidity  
 
The following represents Big National Charity’s financial assets at December 31, 20XX and 20XX:  
 
 
Big National Charity’s goal is generally to maintain financial assets to meet 90 days of operating expenses 
(approximately $1.4 million). As part of its liquidity plan, excess c ash is invested in short -term 
investments, including money market accounts and certificates of deposit. Big National Charity has a

Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policie s 
 
Basis of presentation  –The financial statements of Big National Charity, Inc.  have been prepared in 
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""US GAAP""), which require Big National

net asset  classifications:   
 
Net assets without donor r estrictions : Net assets that are not subject to donor -imposed 
restrictions and may be expended for any purpose in  performing the primary objectives of the 
organization. The se net assets may be used at the  discre tion of Big National Charity, Inc. 's 
management and the board of directors . 
 
Net assets with donor restrictions : Net assets subject to stipulations imposed by donor s, and 
grantor s. Some donor restrictions are temporary in nature;  those restrictions will be  met by 
actions of Big National Charity , Inc.  or by the passage of time. Other donor restrictions are 
perpetual in nature, where by the donor has stipulated the funds be maintained in perpetuity.  
 
Donor restricted contributions are reported as increases i n net assets with donor restrictions. 
When a restriction expires, net assets are reclassified from net assets with donor restrictions to 
net assets without donor restrictions in the statement s of activities.

in net assets  from operati ng and non operating activities. Operating activities consist of those items

Concentrations of credit risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject Big National Charity, Inc.  
to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and investments. Big 
National Charity, Inc.  maintains its  cash and cash equivalents in various bank accounts that, at times, may 
exceed federally insured limits.  Big National Charity, Inc. 's cash and cash e quivalent accounts have been 
placed with high credit quality  financial institutions. Big National Charity, Inc.  has not experienced, nor 
does it anticipate, any losses with  respect to such accounts.   
 
Contributions receivable  Unconditional promises to give that are expected to be collected within one 
year are recorded at net  realizable value. Unconditional promises to give that are expected to be collected 
in future years are  recorded at the present value of their estimated future cash flows . The discounts on 
those amounts are  computed using risk -adjusted interest rates applicable to the years in which the 
promises are received.  Discount amortization is  included in contribution revenue. Conditional promises 
to give are not  included as support  until the conditions are met.   
 
As of December 31, 20 XX, Big National Charity, Inc. 's contributions receivable consisted of unconditional  
promises to give in the amount of $150,000  and receivables from third party processors in the amount of 
$94,000, all of which are expected to be collected  within one year. As of December 31, 20 XX, contributions 
receivable consisted of unconditional promises to  give in the amount of $301,000  and receivables from 
third party pr ocessors in the amount of $108,000 .  
 
Due to/from related parties  Amounts reported as due to/from related parties, included in the 
accompanying statement s of financial position,  arise principally from the collaborative activities between 
Big National Charity, Inc. , Big National Charity, Inc.  Interna tional, and Big National Charity, Inc.  Canada to 
further the mission of the organization.   
 
Property and equipment, net  Property and equipment are stated at cost at the date of purchase or, for 
donated assets, at  fair value at the date of donation, less accumulated  depreciation. Depreciation is 
calculated using the straight -line method over the lesser of the estimated  useful lives of the assets or the 
lease term. The useful lives range from three to seven years. Big Na tional Charity, Inc. 's policy is to 
capitalize renewals and betterments acquired for greater than $5,000 and expense  normal repairs and 
maintenance as incurred. Big National Charity, Inc. 's management periodically  evaluates whether events 
or circumstances have occurred indicating that the carrying amount of long -lived  assets may not be 
recovered.   
 
Investments  Investments are reported at cost , if purchased, or at fair value, if donated . Thereafter, 
investments are reported at their fair values in the statements of financial position, and c hanges in fair 
value are reported as investment  return in the statement s of activities.   
 
Purchases and sales of securities are reflected on a trade -date basis. Gains and losses on sales of securities  
are based on ave rage cost and are recorded in the statement s of activities in the period in which the 
securities  are sold. Interest is recorded when earned. Dividends are accrued as of the ex -dividend date.

 Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued ) 
 
Fair value measurements  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset  in 
the principal or most advantageous market for the asset in an orderly transaction  between market 
participants on the measurement date. Fair value sho uld be based on the assumptions  market participants 
would use when pricing an asset . US GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes  investments 
based on those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to  quoted prices in  active 
markets (observable inputs) and the lowest priority to an entity's assumptions  (unobservable inputs). Big 
National Charity, Inc.  groups assets at fair value in three levels,  based on the markets in which the assets 
and liabilities are traded and th e reliability of the assumptions used  to determine fair value. These levels 
are:  
 
Level 1  Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of 
the measurement date.   
 
Level 2  Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including:   
• Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets;   
• Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non -active markets;   
• Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset/liability; and,  
• Inputs that are derived principally from or c orroborated by other observable market 
data.   
 
Level 3  Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data.   
 
Contributions Contributions received are recorded as net assets without donor restri ctions or net 
assets with donor restrictions , depending on the existence and/or nature of any donor -imposed  
restrictions. Contributions that are restricted by the donor are reported as an increase in net assets  
without donor  restrictions if the restriction  expires in the reporting period in which the contribution is 
recognized. All other donor  restricted contributions are reported as an increase in net assets  with donor 
restrictions , depending on the nature of restriction. When a restriction expires (that i s, when a stipulated 
time restriction ends or purpose restriction is accomplished ), net assets  with donor restrictions  are 
reclassified to net assets  without donor restrictions  and reported in the statement s of activities as net 
assets released from restri ctions.   
 
Contributed property and equipment are recorded at fair value at the date of donation. Contributions  with 
donor -imposed stipulations regarding how long the contributed assets must be used are recorded as  net 
assets with donor restrictions ; otherw ise, the contributions are recorded as net assets without donor 
restrictions .

In-kind donations  Big National Charity, Inc.  received donated professional services  and other 
advertising services of  $13,000 for the year ended December 31, 20 XX. Such amounts, which are based 
upon  information provided by third -party service providers, are recorded at their estimated fair value 
determined  on the date of contribution and are reported as cont ributions in -kind and supporting services  
on the accompanying statements of activities and statements of functional expenses.   
 
Several volunteers have made significant contributions of their time in furtherance of Big National Charity, 
Inc.'s mission. These services were not reflected in the accompanying statement s of activities because  
they do not meet the necessary criteria for recognition under US GAAP .  
 
Functional expenses  The costs of providing program and other  activities have been summarized on a 
functional  basis in the statement s of activities. Accordingly, certain costs have been allocated among 
animal services  and supporting services benefited. Such allocations are determined by management on 
an equitable ba sis.  
 
The expenses that are allocated include the following:  
 
Expense Method of Allocation
Grants Time and effort
Salaries and benefits Time and effort
Education and awareness Time and effort
Occupancy Square Footage
Professional services Full Time Equivalent

Information technologies Full Time Equivalent
Travel Time and effort
Depreciation Square Footage
Other Time and effort
 
 
Use of estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with  US GAAP  requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported  amounts and  disclosures. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

New Accounting Pronouncement  On August 18, 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016 -14, Not -for-Profit 
Entities (Topic 958) Presentation of Financial Statements of Not -for-Profit Entities . The update addresses 
the complexity and understandability of net asset classification, deficiencies in information about liquidity

Concentrations of credit risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject Big National Charity, Inc.  
to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and investments. Big 
National Charity, Inc.  maintains its  cash and cash equivalents in various bank accounts that, at times, may 
exceed federally insured limits.  Big National Charity, Inc. 's cash and cash e quivalent accounts have been 
placed with high credit quality  financial institutions. Big National Charity, Inc.  has not experienced, nor 
does it anticipate, any losses with  respect to such accounts.   
 
Contributions receivable  Unconditional promises to give that are expected to be collected within one 
year are recorded at net  realizable value. Unconditional promises to give that are expected to be collected 
in future years are  recorded at the present value of their estimated future cash flows . The discounts on 
those amounts are  computed using risk -adjusted interest rates applicable to the years in which the 
promises are received.  Discount amortization is  included in contribution revenue. Conditional promises 
to give are not  included as support  until the conditions are met.   
 
As of December 31, 20 XX, Big National Charity, Inc. 's contributions receivable consisted of unconditional  
promises to give in the amount of $150,000  and receivables from third party processors in the amount of 
$94,000, all of which are expected to be collected  within one year. As of December 31, 20 XX, contributions 
receivable consisted of unconditional promises to  give in the amount of $301,000  and receivables from 
third party pr ocessors in the amount of $108,000 .  
 
Due to/from related parties  Amounts reported as due to/from related parties, included in the 
accompanying statement s of financial position,  arise principally from the collaborative activities between 
Big National Charity, Inc. , Big National Charity, Inc.  Interna tional, and Big National Charity, Inc.  Canada to 
further the mission of the organization.   
 
Property and equipment, net  Property and equipment are stated at cost at the date of purchase or, for 
donated assets, at  fair value at the date of donation, less accumulated  depreciation. Depreciation is 
calculated using the straight -line method over the lesser of the estimated  useful lives of the assets or the 
lease term. The useful lives range from three to seven years. Big Na tional Charity, Inc. 's policy is to 
capitalize renewals and betterments acquired for greater than $5,000 and expense  normal repairs and 
maintenance as incurred. Big National Charity, Inc. 's management periodically  evaluates whether events 
or circumstances have occurred indicating that the carrying amount of long -lived  assets may not be 
recovered.   
 
Investments  Investments are reported at cost , if purchased, or at fair value, if donated . Thereafter, 
investments are reported at their fair values in the statements of financial position, and c hanges in fair 
value are reported as investment  return in the statement s of activities.   
 
Purchases and sales of securities are reflected on a trade -date basis. Gains and losses on sales of securities  
are based on ave rage cost and are recorded in the statement s of activities in the period in which the 
securities  are sold. Interest is recorded when earned. Dividends are accrued as of the ex -dividend date.

Fair value measurements  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset  in 
the principal or most advantageous market for the asset in an orderly transaction  between market 
participants on the measurement date. Fair value sho uld be based on the assumptions  market participants 
would use when pricing an asset . US GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes  investments 
based on those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to  quoted prices in  active 
markets (observable inputs) and the lowest priority to an entity's assumptions  (unobservable inputs). Big 
National Charity, Inc.  groups assets at fair value in three levels,  based on the markets in which the assets 
and liabilities are traded and th e reliability of the assumptions used  to determine fair value. These levels 
are:  
 
Level 1  Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of 
the measurement date.   
 
Level 2  Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including:   
• Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets;   
• Quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non -active markets;   
• Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset/liability; and,  
• Inputs that are derived principally from or c orroborated by other observable market 
data.   
 
Level 3  Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data.   
 
Contributions Contributions received are recorded as net assets without donor restri ctions or net 
assets with donor restrictions , depending on the existence and/or nature of any donor -imposed  
restrictions. Contributions that are restricted by the donor are reported as an increase in net assets  
without donor  restrictions if the restriction  expires in the reporting period in which the contribution is 
recognized. All other donor  restricted contributions are reported as an increase in net assets  with donor 
restrictions , depending on the nature of restriction. When a restriction expires (that i s, when a stipulated 
time restriction ends or purpose restriction is accomplished ), net assets  with donor restrictions  are 
reclassified to net assets  without donor restrictions  and reported in the statement s of activities as net 
assets released from restri ctions.   
 
Contributed property and equipment are recorded at fair value at the date of donation. Contributions  with 
donor -imposed stipulations regarding how long the contributed assets must be used are recorded as  net 
assets with donor restrictions ; otherw ise, the contributions are recorded as net assets without donor 
restrictions .

advertising services of  $13,000 for the year ended December 31, 20 XX. Such amounts, which are based 
upon  information provided by third -party service providers, are recorded at their estimated fair value

on the accompanying statements of activities and statements of functional expenses.   
 
Several volunteers have made significant contributions of their time in furtherance of Big National Charity, 
Inc.'s mission. These services were not reflected in the accompanying statement s of activities because

functional  basis in the statement s of activities. Accordingly, certain costs have been allocated among
